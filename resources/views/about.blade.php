                    <li>We have a very sophisticated module-based, divide &amp; conquer software development
                    approach which helps us in properly identifying and understanding every aspect of the project. </li>
                    <li>Our designers are trained to create a sophisticated, yet simple and efficient user interface. We
                        get a proper design analysis from our clients before starting any development so that we can
                    understand our clients’ requirements and develop accordingly. </li>
                    <li>After development, we test every software module individually and again test it after
                        integrating entire software for making sure that there are no bugs left for the client to suffer
                    through. </li>
                    <li>We love feedback from our clients. It makes us realize our strong and weak points. </li>
                    <li>We provide 24*7 maintenance up to a decided timespan after handing over the software to the
                    client. </li>
